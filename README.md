# Fomo

40 hr end of semester project for IS Junior Core INTEX II exercise.

Worked on by Branden Clark, Kiersten Ernstorm, and Patrik Drean.

Fully functioning e-commerce site. Integrated with Stripe, Active Directory,a custom built 
  Windows 2012 Server, and runs on HTTP/S. Also has functioning APIs to call from.

Possibly still up on http://musical-family.me if BYU hasn't turned our servers off yet,
  which they probably haven't. HTTPS certificate expired and we don't want to renew it now,
  so don't worry, we aren't trying to steal your life when you visit.

**With love,**

Branden
